    - question: "What is Nurture Games?"
      answer: "Nurture Games is a mobile application in development for Apple and Android mobile phones and tablets. In Nurture Games your child plays games that are specially designed to be fun and engaging while making your child think and develop brains. Our games are designed for children with special needs between 4 to 8 with the help of the latest neuroscience research in learning and development. Our games are also enjoyable and potentially beneficial for anyone older.
      
      For the past four years, we have been developing games in various forms and working with children to scientifically and objectively evaluate the effects of our games. We have found a formula that significantly improves the learning experience of children. Using this formula, we are creating Nurture Games, with the goal of making life easier for special needs children and their families."
    - question: "How it can help my child ?"
      answer: "According to the latest neuroscience research, repetition helps develop neural pathways in the brain. As these neural pathways develop, it is known that the learned information becomes easier to access. Nurture Games uses this principle in its games to make your child repetitively use basic mathematical concepts to grasp them very well. Our games learn how well your child knows certain logical and mathematical concepts. It tracks their key executive functioning skills. Based on this information, we adapt the game to suit the difficulty that your child can work with. This is helpful, especially for children with various learning disabilities.  Based on this, we adapt the game to your child so that they are challenged to an extent that they can handle. We also challenge your child by rewarding them for playing games that use concepts that they are not good at yet. This motivates them to learn new information and use skills that they are not good at.
      
      Overall, we help your child develop basic executive function skills in the context of various learning goals. These skills and learning goals will help them immensely for the rest of their lives. We see that the investment children put in by playing our games provides an immeasurable value in their school life.
